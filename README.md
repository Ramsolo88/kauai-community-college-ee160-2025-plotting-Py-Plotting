# Py-Plotting
A set of problems to introduce plotting with matplotlib.

# Task List:

### 1:
&emsp; Write a script that imports numpy and matplotlib.

### 2:
&emsp; Define 3 x value arrays. One will contain 100 points, the second will contain 10,000 points, and the last will contain 1,000,000 points. (If your computer freezes for more than a couple seconds at 1,000,000 points, you may lower the count as needed.)

### 3:
&emsp; Define 3 y value arrays. Pick a function from the numpy library, and calculate the y values for each of your x value arrays. (You can't use the sin or cos function for this task, since I already showed you that code.) Be careful, make sure your x ranges don't land on an undefined value!

### 4:
&emsp; Make a plot with a title and legend showing your data at 10,000 points. How long did it take for your computer to make a plot of 1,000,000?

### 5:
&emsp; Set your plot to a pretty color that isn't default!
